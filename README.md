# OLX-New-Listing-Notifier

The OLX-New-Listing-Notifier script is designed to alert you about new OLX listings at regular intervals via email. To get started, you'll need a Gmail account to send the notifications. Below is a quick setup guide.

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## 2. Clone the Repository

Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teodositashev/OLX-New-Listing-Notifier.git
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

Open your command prompt and run the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pyyaml
pip install requests
```

## 4. Configure `config.yaml`

In the `config.yaml` file, you will need to specify the following:

- **link**: Your OLX search query.
- **time_interval**: The interval (in minutes) at which you want to be notified.
- **sender_email**: The Gmail account that will send the notifications.
- **receiver_email**: The email account (which can be any email provider) where you want to receive notifications.

## 5. Setting Up Your Gmail

   - Generate a new App Password. You can name the app anything you like (e.g., OLX Notifier).
   - Copy the 16-character password provided.

3. **Set Up a System Variable**:
   - Create a system environment variable named `OLX_NOTIFIER_PASSWORD` with the value set to the App Password you copied.
   - Restart your IDE to apply the changes.

## Future Imrpovements
